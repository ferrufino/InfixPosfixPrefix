With the use of the STL library (Stack and Queue) I've been assigned to convert an Infix notation to a Postfix and Prefix notation. 
Also, to evaluate the result for each operation. 

Then implement my own version of Stack and Queue classes, with a doble chained list for Queue and a circular list, with a pointer pointing
at the bottom of the Stack.
